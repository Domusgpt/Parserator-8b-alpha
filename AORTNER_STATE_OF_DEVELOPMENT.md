## 2. Product & Engineering Status
### 2.1 Core Services
- **API:** Architect-Extractor pipeline running on Firebase Functions v2 with Gemini 1.5 Flash, demonstrating ~2.2s responses at ~95% accuracy; production TypeScript codebase compiled and verified.【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L9-L44】【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L7-L31】
- **Shared Core Library:** TypeScript interfaces/utilities compiled for consumption across packages; maintains plug-and-play philosophy to honor Wide Market Autonomy (WMA).【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L156-L164】【F:AGENTS.md†L25-L41】

### 2.2 Client Surfaces
- **Dashboard:** Next.js 14 static export with professional Tailwind design, API-key management, and usage analytics ready for branding polish; currently backed by placeholder data pending live wiring.【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L45-L83】【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L118-L132】
- **SDKs & Integrations:** Node SDK (`parserator-sdk@1.0.0`), MCP server (`parserator-mcp-server@1.0.1`), and framework examples confirmed working; Python SDK queued for publication post-strategic review.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L25-L44】
- **Extensions:** Chrome, VS Code, and JetBrains plugins are feature-complete with packaged assets awaiting marketplace submission (Chrome store blocked by domain SSL).【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L45-L80】【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L90-L155】

### 2.3 Specialized Services
- Email parsing services verified functional and aligned with liberation use cases for ingestion pipelines.【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L134-L155】

## 3. Operational Readiness & Environment
- **Development workspace:** `active-development/` mirrors production packages with build/test scripts ready; supporting directories provide testing validation and contextual documentation for agents.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L97-L132】
- **Tooling baselines:** Node 22.15.0, TypeScript 5.2.2, ESLint 8.52.0; all packages build despite minor engine deprecation notices deemed non-blocking.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L118-L132】
- **Quality posture:** Comprehensive manual test suites (>20 scenarios) plus diagnostic utilities in place; orientation instructions emphasize telemetry parity and swappable modules.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L14-L44】【F:AGENTS.md†L1-L41】

## 4. Market & Launch Readiness
- **Marketing arsenal:** 100+ launch assets (social, blog, email, community, Product Hunt) ready for deployment once strategic hold lifts; messaging focuses on EMA "data liberation" narrative and 70% token savings proof points.【F:COMPLETE_PROJECT_AUDIT.md†L60-L115】【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L81-L116】
- **Branding gaps:** New logo/video assets completed but not yet embedded across dashboard, marketing surfaces, or Chrome extension; integration scheduled post-domain remediation.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L54-L72】
- **Community strategy:** Waitlist and mystique-driven campaigns prioritized over immediate open-source drops to protect MVEP/PPP edge.【F:CRITICAL_PROJECT_STATE.md†L36-L128】

## 5. Blockers & Risks
| Priority | Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 | **Custom domain SSL misconfiguration** | Browser warnings block trust, Chrome store submission requires valid privacy policy endpoint | Re-run Firebase Hosting custom domain setup, verify certificate, redeploy security headers.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L45-L63】 |
| 🔴 | **Brand asset rollout pending** | Inconsistent experience vs. marketing narrative | Integrate final logo/video across dashboard, marketing, extension packages after SSL fix.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L64-L78】 |
| 🔴 | **Chrome Web Store submission outstanding** | Limits distribution of verified extension | Complete submission sequence once domain is trusted; assets already packaged.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L79-L96】【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L90-L120】 |
| 🟡 | **Dashboard mock data** | Usage metrics not yet real-time | Connect dashboard API layer to live endpoints after blockers cleared.【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L118-L132】 |
| 🟡 | **Framework integration verification** | Claims risk erosion if untested | Schedule validation passes for ADK, CrewAI, AutoGPT connectors post-launch blockers.【F:PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md†L132-L155】 |

## 6. Strategic Directives & Next Steps
1. **Honor the Strategic Hold:** Maintain control over MVEP/PPP disclosures, with any release gated by leadership approval and revised timelines.【F:CRITICAL_PROJECT_STATE.md†L1-L128】
2. **Execute Technical Fix Sprint (Day 0):** Resolve SSL, roll branding, submit Chrome extension following the hour-by-hour action plan already documented.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L97-L140】
3. **Rehearse Launch Playbooks (Day 1-2):** Dry-run marketing sequences, update analytics/telemetry hooks, and align messaging with EMA liberation narrative before any public reactivation.【F:COMPLETE_PROJECT_AUDIT.md†L116-L158】【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L81-L116】
4. **Enable Controlled Access (Day 3+):** Once blockers clear, onboard select partners via API/dashboard to gather testimonials without compromising mystique; monitor via existing test suites and telemetry instructions.【F:PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md†L14-L44】【F:CRITICAL_PROJECT_STATE.md†L36-L128】

## 7. Signal Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] SSL certificates validated and automated renewals confirmed
- [ ] Branding assets consistent across dashboard, extensions, marketing
- [ ] Chrome Web Store submission accepted and in review
- [ ] Dashboard fetching live metrics from production API
- [ ] Strategic hold documentation re-affirmed in onboarding materials
- [ ] Marketing queue staged but paused pending go-live directive

---

**Bottom Line:** Parserator's technical foundation, ecosystem tooling, and marketing engine are in place. Immediate focus must stay on tightening distribution readiness (domain, branding, store submission) while preserving the EMA-aligned scarcity strategy that safeguards MVEP/PPP differentiation. Once the red blockers clear, the team can safely re-engage go-to-market motions without compromising core intellectual property.
