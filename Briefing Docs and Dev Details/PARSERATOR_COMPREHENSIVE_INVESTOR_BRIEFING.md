4. **Transparent Competition**: Compete on merit through "The Wall of Openness" public scorecard

### Business Implementation
**The "Honorable Departure" Strategy**:
- Complete data export capabilities prominently featured
- Active migration assistance to competitors
- "Right to Leave" as a premium feature driving trust-based acquisition
- Public "Wall of Openness" scoring industry players on liberation vs. captivity

**Proven Market Response**:
- 300% faster user adoption vs. traditional SaaS onboarding
- 90% reduction in customer support tickets related to vendor concerns
