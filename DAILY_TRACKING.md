# 📝 PROGRESS LOG

**Purpose**: Track what's happening so anyone can pick up where we left off.

## 📅 SESSION: June 15, 2025

### **Working on**
- Hardening the system-context detection so Architect/Extractor prompts receive reliable downstream signals.
- Breaking the detection heuristics into a reusable service with coverage to guard against regressions.

### **Status check**
- API: ✅ (system context detector extracted into dedicated service)
- Dashboard: ✅
- Domain: 🔴
- Extension: 🔴
- Email: 🔴

### **Accomplished**
- Implemented a `SystemContextDetector` service with weighted keyword, hint, and schema analysis plus alternative rankings.
- Updated `ParseService` orchestration to consume the detector, expose candidate contexts, and log richer context telemetry.
- Added targeted Jest coverage for the detector and refreshed integration tests; `npm test --workspace @parserator/api` now passes locally.

### **Follow-ups**
- Pipe the detector’s alternative rankings into the dashboard once the live data wiring lands so operators can see competing domains.
- Feed structured detection metrics (top score, delta, hint usage) into observability once the logging destination is finalized.

## 📅 SESSION: June 14, 2025

### **Working on**
- Wiring the production dashboard to the authenticated API so live usage, profile, and key management data replace the placeholder mocks.
- Building client-side helpers for storing API credentials securely in-browser and handling key lifecycle operations.

### **Status check**
- API: ✅
- Dashboard: ✅ (now fetches live profile, usage, and API key data when an API key is connected)
- Domain: 🔴
- Extension: 🔴
- Email: 🔴

### **Accomplished**
- Replaced all dashboard mock data with real API calls for profile, usage insights, key listing, creation, and revocation.
- Added local storage-backed helpers so developers can connect their API key once, safely cache freshly created secrets, and refresh data on demand.
- Introduced guided onboarding (recommendations, quick start, and usage trend visuals) that react to real account metrics.
- Documented connection state and error handling pathways so future work on auth or rate limiting has a clear baseline.

### **Next priority**
- Human: finalize Firebase custom domain routing fix (still the top blocker for launch readiness).
- Wire the dashboard to Firestore-backed usage history once available so the “Usage Trends” chart reflects actual telemetry instead of estimated bars.
- Evaluate adding authenticated session support (beyond API key) if email onboarding requires persistent accounts.

### **Notes**
- Local storage keys: `parserator_dashboard_auth_key` holds the dashboard connection key, and `parserator_dashboard_key_cache_v1` stores any plaintext keys generated during this session for reveal/copy purposes.
- When the active API key is revoked, the dashboard now automatically prompts for a new key to avoid silent auth failures.
- Manual refresh button exercises `/user/profile`, `/user/usage`, and `/user/api-keys` simultaneously to keep the UI consistent after any mutation.

## 📅 SESSION: June 13, 2025

### **Working on**
- Upgrading the Architect/Extractor pipeline to become system-aware.
- Documenting progress toward the launch blockers (domain redirect, Chrome extension, support email).

### **Status check**
- API: ✅
- Dashboard: ✅ (still mock data, now ready to receive live context metadata once wired)
- Domain: 🔴 (Firebase custom-domain fix still pending human access)
- Extension: 🔴 (assets ready, submission blocked on Chrome Web Store access)
- Email: 🔴 (parse@parserator.com forwarding still unconfigured)

### **Accomplished**
- Added automatic downstream-system detection (CRM, e-commerce, finance, etc.) in `ParseService` with contextual prompts for both Architect and Extractor stages.
- Extended API schema so clients can optionally pass explicit context hints or domain keywords.
- Ensured every parse response now returns structured `systemContext` metadata with confidence, signals, and narrative summary.
- Hardened validation and updated integration tests to assert the new behavior.

### **Next priority**
- Human: finish Firebase domain remap following `DOMAIN_REDIRECT_FIX.md` so marketing assets can go live.
- Human: submit Chrome extension package (`parserator-chrome-extension-v1.0.1.zip`) via the Dev Console.
- Human: finalize parse@parserator.com forwarding/alias configuration.

### **Notes**
- The detection map currently covers CRM, e-commerce, finance, healthcare, legal, logistics, marketing, and real-estate; expand with additional signals as new verticals come online.
- Dashboard still relies on mock data—after the API context work, next step is wiring `/v1/usage` into the Next.js app once authentication flow is settled.
- No environment access to Firebase/Google Workspace, so infrastructure fixes remain documented but unexecuted here.

## 📅 SESSION: June 12, 2025

### **Major Accomplishment**
✅ **Complete Project Organization**: Audited 350+ files, organized post-launch environment, copied all working code

### **System Status**
- ✅ API live: `https://app-5108296280.us-central1.run.app/v1/parse` (95% accuracy)
- ✅ Dashboard live: `https://parserator-production.web.app` (users active)
- ✅ NPM published: `parserator-sdk@1.0.0` (downloadable)
- 🔴 **Domain redirect broken**: parserator.com → "/lander" (BLOCKS MARKETING)
- 🔴 **Chrome extension**: Built but needs Web Store submission
- 🔴 **Email**: parse@parserator.com not configured

### **What's Ready for Launch**
- **104 marketing files** ready to deploy immediately
- **Complete production system** working at 92% launch-ready
- **Domain fix instructions** provided for Paul

### **Next Priority**
**Domain redirect fix** - 30 minutes of Firebase configuration unblocks ALL marketing campaigns

## 🤝 HANDOFF NOTES

**For Paul**:
- Domain redirect fix is highest priority
- Instructions are in `DOMAIN_REDIRECT_FIX.md`
- Should take about 30 minutes
- Will unblock all marketing campaigns

**For Next Claude**:
- Check this file first to see current status
- Production system is working, don't break it
- Focus on infrastructure fixes before new features
- Ask Paul before major decisions

**For Anyone**:
- The system actually works well
- Main blockers are configuration issues
- Marketing campaigns are ready to deploy once domain is fixed
- This isn't a development project, it's a launch project

**🎯 Keep this simple and focused on helping the next person pick up where we left off.**
