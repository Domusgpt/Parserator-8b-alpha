# 📝 PROGRESS LOG

**Purpose**: Track what's happening so anyone can pick up where we left off.

---

## 📅 SESSION: June 13, 2025

### **Working on**
- Upgrading the Architect/Extractor pipeline to become system-aware.
- Documenting progress toward the launch blockers (domain redirect, Chrome extension, support email).

### **Status check**
- API: ✅
- Dashboard: ✅ (still mock data, now ready to receive live context metadata once wired)
- Domain: 🔴 (Firebase custom-domain fix still pending human access)
- Extension: 🔴 (assets ready, submission blocked on Chrome Web Store access)
- Email: 🔴 (parse@parserator.com forwarding still unconfigured)

### **Accomplished**
- Added automatic downstream-system detection (CRM, e-commerce, finance, etc.) in `ParseService` with contextual prompts for both Architect and Extractor stages.
- Extended API schema so clients can optionally pass explicit context hints or domain keywords.
- Ensured every parse response now returns structured `systemContext` metadata with confidence, signals, and narrative summary.
- Hardened validation and updated integration tests to assert the new behavior.

### **Next priority**
- Human: finish Firebase domain remap following `DOMAIN_REDIRECT_FIX.md` so marketing assets can go live.
- Human: submit Chrome extension package (`parserator-chrome-extension-v1.0.1.zip`) via the Dev Console.
- Human: finalize parse@parserator.com forwarding/alias configuration.

### **Notes**
- The detection map currently covers CRM, e-commerce, finance, healthcare, legal, logistics, marketing, and real-estate; expand with additional signals as new verticals come online.
- Dashboard still relies on mock data—after the API context work, next step is wiring `/v1/usage` into the Next.js app once authentication flow is settled.
- No environment access to Firebase/Google Workspace, so infrastructure fixes remain documented but unexecuted here.

## 📅 SESSION: June 12, 2025

### **Major Accomplishment**
✅ **Complete Project Organization**: Audited 350+ files, organized post-launch environment, copied all working code

### **System Status**
- ✅ API live: `https://app-5108296280.us-central1.run.app/v1/parse` (95% accuracy)
- ✅ Dashboard live: `https://parserator-production.web.app` (users active)
- ✅ NPM published: `parserator-sdk@1.0.0` (downloadable)
- 🔴 **Domain redirect broken**: parserator.com → "/lander" (BLOCKS MARKETING)
- 🔴 **Chrome extension**: Built but needs Web Store submission
- 🔴 **Email**: parse@parserator.com not configured

### **What's Ready for Launch**
- **104 marketing files** ready to deploy immediately
- **Complete production system** working at 92% launch-ready
- **Domain fix instructions** provided for Paul
