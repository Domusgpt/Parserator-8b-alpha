# 📝 PROGRESS LOG

## 📅 SESSION: October 21, 2025

### **Working on**
Phase 3 – Support Channels Online (support email readiness)

**Status check**:
- API: ✅
- Dashboard: ✅
- Domain: 🔴
- Extension: 🟡 (package staged, submission waiting on domain policy URL)
- Email: 🟡 (runbook & evidence scaffolding ready; mailbox access pending)

**Accomplished**:
- Authored `docs/SUPPORT_EMAIL_RUNBOOK.md` covering Workspace setup, DNS requirements, testing, autoresponder copy, and monitoring.
- Created `testing-validation/email/` structure with verification template and README so auditors know where to place evidence.
- Logged Phase 3 progress in `docs/LAUNCH_ROADMAP.md`, clarifying what remains blocked on external admin credentials.

**Next priority**:
- Obtain Workspace or registrar access to execute the MX + mailbox configuration steps outlined in the runbook.
- Capture inbound/outbound/autoresponder evidence files and commit them under `testing-validation/email/` once tests run.
- Enable autoresponder + escalation workflow, then update checkboxes in the runbook close-out section.

**Notes**:
- No credentials were available during this session, so all work focused on documentation and evidence scaffolding for the operator who can complete the MX changes.

### **Working on**
Phase 2 – Distribution Greenlight (Chrome extension submission prep)

**Status check**:
- API: ✅
- Dashboard: ✅
- Domain: 🔴 (privacy policy URL still blocked by redirect fix)
- Extension: 🟡 (package rebuilt; waiting on submission window)
- Email: 🔴

**Accomplished**:
- Rebuilt the production ZIP with manifest/package version 1.0.1 so the artifact name and metadata align for Web Store submission.
- Captured SHA256 checksum, file inventory, and manifest snippet evidence under `testing-validation/chrome-extension/` for audit traceability.
- Reviewed bundled screenshots and promo tiles to confirm refreshed branding is already included in the submission assets folder.

**Next priority**:
- Coordinate with Phase 1 owners to close the parserator.com redirect issue so the privacy-policy URL is submission-ready.
- Populate Chrome Web Store listing metadata once the domain is verified, then upload the refreshed package and monitor review status.
- Mirror submission status and review responses in both this log and the roadmap once the console workflow begins.

**Notes**:
- All local assets are ready; store submission cannot proceed until parserator.com serves the privacy policy over HTTPS without redirects.

### **Working on**
Phase 1 – Production Access Ready (domain redirect remediation)

**Status check**:
- API: ✅
- Dashboard: ✅
- Domain: 🔴 (awaiting Firebase console update)
- Extension: 🔴
- Email: 🔴

**Accomplished**:
- Archived baseline HTTPS response headers at `testing-validation/domain/2025-10-18-parserator-com-headers.txt` for the parserator.com domain prior to console changes.
- Updated the Phase 1 roadmap checklist so evidence capture is tracked and downstream tasks remain visible.
- Expanded `DOMAIN_REDIRECT_FIX.md` with baseline evidence instructions to guide whoever completes the Firebase Hosting update.

**Next priority**:
- Gain Firebase console access to confirm the current primary domain and remove any legacy `/lander` redirect rules.
- Capture dashboard screenshots over HTTPS immediately after the console change and archive them alongside the CLI traces.
- Reflect the final verification in both this log and `DOMAIN_REDIRECT_FIX.md` so marketing can proceed.

**Notes**:
- Console access is the remaining blocker; all preparatory evidence gathering is complete and waiting for the change window.

- Coordinate with domain registrar to validate DNS/SSL status if discrepancies appear.
