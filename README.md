# 🚀 PARSERATOR - POST-LAUNCH DEVELOPMENT

**What is Parserator?** Revolutionary AI data parsing platform using Architect-Extractor pattern for 95% accuracy and 70% cost reduction.

**Current Status:** 92% launch-ready. Live API serving users. 3 infrastructure fixes block marketing launch.

## 🎯 HOW PARSERATOR WORKS

### **The Revolutionary Two-Stage Process**

**Stage 1 - The Architect** (Gemini 1.5 Flash):
- Takes your desired output schema + small data sample
- Creates detailed parsing plan (SearchPlan)
- Operates on tiny data sample = low token cost

**Stage 2 - The Extractor** (Gemini 1.5 Flash):
- Takes full data + SearchPlan from Architect
- Executes parsing with direct instructions
- No complex reasoning needed = efficient execution

**Result**: 70% token savings, 95% accuracy, ~2.2s response time

### **What Users Experience**
```javascript
// Simple API call
POST https://app-5108296280.us-central1.run.app/v1/parse
{
  "inputData": "messy unstructured data...",
  "outputSchema": {"name": "string", "email": "string"},
  "instructions": "extract contact info"
}

// Get clean structured output
{
  "success": true,
  "parsedData": {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"},
  "metadata": {"confidence": 0.95, "tokensUsed": 449}
}
```

### 🧠 Lean Agent Core (2024 Refresh)
- `ParseratorCore` now boots a modular architect → resolver → extractor pipeline so builders can plug in new field resolvers without rewriting orchestration, yet still ship with helpful defaults for zero-credential use.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L36-L188】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/resolvers.ts†L1-L365】
- Section-aware heuristics segment messy transcripts into headings, unlocking currency/percentage/address/name extraction without LLM calls and providing richer diagnostics for downstream agents.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/heuristics.ts†L1-L146】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/resolvers.ts†L78-L312】
- Swap in custom agents at runtime via `setArchitect`/`setExtractor`, register resolvers with `registerResolver`, and adjust heuristics through `updateConfig`—no heavyweight kernel API required.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L107-L170】
- Choose the right vibe with built-in profiles (`lean-agent`, `vibe-coder`, `sensor-grid`) or your own `ParseratorProfile` so agents, hackers, and sensor rigs can dial heuristics with a single call to `applyProfile` or the API's `setCoreProfile`.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/profiles.ts†L1-L86】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L107-L188】【F:active-development/packages/api/src/services/parse.service.ts†L93-L143】
- Launch reusable `ParseratorSession`s with `createSession` to cache architect plans, stream batched parses, inspect confidence snapshots, and keep token spend low for agents or sensor data that share schemas.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L34-L276】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/types.ts†L219-L299】
- Recalibrate cached plans on-demand with `session.refreshPlan()` and inspect plan telemetry with `session.getPlanState()`/`session.snapshot()` so agents can swap instructions, seed inputs, or thresholds without rewriting orchestration.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L120-L344】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/types.ts†L219-L327】
- Attach auto-refresh guardrails to sessions via the new `autoRefresh` config so plans regenerate automatically when confidence dips or after a set number of parses, and audit cooldown/trigger state with `session.getAutoRefreshState()` or `session.snapshot()`.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/types.ts†L219-L308】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L34-L360】
- Hydrate long-lived workflows by calling `core.createSessionFromResponse` on any parse result or exporting portable session inits with `session.exportInit()` so agents can persist plans across workers, queues, or cold starts without rebuilding heuristics.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L188-L274】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L270-L318】
- Run quick batches with `parseMany` to fan over shared schemas, automatically reuse cached plans, and keep interceptors/telemetry aligned without manual session wiring.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L200-L302】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/types.ts†L49-L68】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/utils.ts†L63-L92】
- Persist SearchPlans automatically across parses with the built-in plan cache (swap it via `planCache` or reuse the new `createInMemoryPlanCache`) and now tune guardrails with `planCachePolicy` so you can reject low-confidence plans, declare stale windows, and expire entries without touching orchestration. Every parse/session metadata payload surfaces `planCache` diagnostics so ops teams can see hits, misses, staleness, and refresh timestamps in-line.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L300-L580】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L720-L1040】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/cache.ts†L1-L120】
- Instrument every parse with the optional telemetry hub so agents, dashboards, or ops tooling can subscribe to lifecycle events (start, stage metrics, plan caching, success/failure) across both direct core usage and long-lived sessions.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L50-L312】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L64-L420】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/telemetry.ts†L1-L64】
- Register kernel-level interceptors with `core.use()` (or pass them at construction) to run custom hooks before parses start, after successes, or on failures across both direct calls and sessions without rewriting orchestration.【F:active-development/packages/core/src/index.ts†L107-L344】【F:active-development/packages/core/src/session.ts†L64-L520】
- The Firebase Functions API and Node SDK now invoke the shared `ParseratorCore`, emitting unified diagnostics and stage metrics so downstream apps consume identical telemetry across SDK and direct API calls.【F:active-development/packages/api/src/services/parse.service.ts†L1-L318】【F:active-development/packages/sdk-node/src/types/index.ts†L1-L116】
- Read `docs/AGENTIC_RELAUNCH.md` for the lean-core rollout plan that aligns the product with EMA/WMA storytelling.【F:docs/AGENTIC_RELAUNCH.md†L1-L78】

```ts
const core = new ParseratorCore({ apiKey: process.env.PARSERATOR_KEY! });
const session = core.createSession({
  outputSchema: { name: 'string', email: 'string' },
  instructions: 'extract the contact record',
  seedInput: sampleTranscript
});

const first = await session.parse(sampleTranscript);
const next = await session.parse(nextTranscript);
console.log(session.snapshot());
```
