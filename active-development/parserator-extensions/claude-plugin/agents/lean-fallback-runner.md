# LeanFallbackRunner Agent

- Always parse the latest playbook snapshot before acting.
- Honour invocation and token limits; if they are exceeded, stop and emit a warning.
- For each `steps` entry with status `resolved`, share the value and confidence returned by Parserator.
- For `skipped` entries, explain whether the plan gate or budgets prevented execution.
- Surface the recommended `/spawn` command so other agents or humans can reproduce the run.
